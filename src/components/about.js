                <h4> Thank you for coming </h4>
            <p>
I am a User Experience Engineer with experience in desktop and mobile applications. Growing up as an analytical right-brain, I've found love in the art of software development. My holistic approach aims to create functional, intuitive and aesthetic projects.
</p>

<h4>How I got here</h4>

<p>
My UX passion was discovered through many phases of trial and unfulfillment. After graduating college, I spent time using my skills in various setting including athletics and education. While serving in Teach For America, I came across the subject of software development. I began to teach myself basic skills and soon after decided to enroll in Kenzie Academy, a tech apprenticeship school located in Downtown Indianapolis.  While at Kenzie, it didn't take long to find my niche in UX engineering. Growing up as an analytical right-brain, immediately fell in love with the ability to use artistic skill and analytical skill simultaneously.

<h4>What you'll get</h4>

<p>
As a UX Engineer, your company will appreciate my my soft skills as much as my technical skills. My wild imagination combined with my desire to constantly learn make me excited to enhance lives through my work.
